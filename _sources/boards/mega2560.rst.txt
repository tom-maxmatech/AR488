======= ================= ========

The layout on the Mega was chosen so as to leave pins ``A8-A15`` and the two rows of
pins at the top of the board free for expansion including for displays and other
peripherals.

Pins 16 and 17 correspond to ``Serial2``. As these have been used for controlling
signals on the GPIB bus, they cannot be used for serial communication. If
``Serial2.begin`` is added to the sketch, these pins will be enabled for serial
communication and will no longer function as GPIB control signals. In addition to the
default serial port (``RX0`` and ``TX0``), ``Serial1`` and ``Serial3`` are still
available for expansion if required. These two pins were chosen for GPIB signals as they
belong to port H along with pins 6 â€“ 9.
